I wanted to create a custom, unique, and cute terminal prompt, so I sacrificed a night's sleep to make it happen.
My inspiration was [this prompt design](https://git.sr.ht/~zethra/sasha-fetch/blob/main/example.png).
I'm sharing my configuration publicly so you can freely copy and modify it. If anyone knows the proper way to create "blank" segments, please let me know - I couldn't figure it out myself.
