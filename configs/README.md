I wanted to create a custom, unique, and cute terminal prompt, so I sacrificed a night's sleep to make it happen.
My inspiration was [this prompt design](https://git.sr.ht/~zethra/sasha-fetch/blob/main/example.png).
Made it public so you can copy and modify it on your own.
I'm sharing my configuration publicly so you can freely copy and modify it. If anyone knows the proper way to create "blank" segments, please let me know - I couldn't figure it out myself.
